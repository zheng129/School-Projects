A program that Simulates the Registrarâ€™s Office operations

Submitted files:
main.cpp
DoubleLinkedList.h
ListNode.h
Queue.h
Simulation.h
Student.h
Simulation.cpp
Student.cpp

test files:
input.txt

Known problem:
For some reasons, cannot organize the Queue.h as the DoubleLinkedList.h and ListNode.h, or  the program would not compile. In the Queue class, all methods must be defined inside the Queue class, otherwise it would not work.

Instruction for running program:
Compile main.cpp file by g++ through console, run the output file a.out or customize the name of the output file. Then follow the instruction inside the program.
