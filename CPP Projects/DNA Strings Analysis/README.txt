Analyzing DNA strings information and generate more DNA strings that match the previous analysis

Submitted files:
main.cpp
input.txt
input1.txt

not sure if should submit a.out and the output file “Yixing Zheng.txt”

Known problem:
The generating strings part is unfinished. I could not find a proper way to generate strings that the length is determined by variance and standard deviation and also follow
the relative frequency calculated previously.

I think I have the right numbers of variance, standard deviation, and relative frequency. However, the last step of actually generating the strings really got me stuck.

Instruction for running program:
Compile main.cpp file by g++ through console, run the output file a.out or customize the name of the output file. Type in the name of the file that user wish to analyze, gaining result in an output file named “Yixing Zheng.txt”. If wish to analyze another file, type in “yes”, and type in the name of the file for another analysis.
