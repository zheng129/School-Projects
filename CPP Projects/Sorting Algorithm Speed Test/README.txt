A program that implements three sorting algorithms: quick sort, insertion sort, and heap sort and counts the runtime of each algorithm.

Submitted files:
main.cpp
Sortings.h
Sortings.cpp
ReportInLaTex.pdf
Report.pdf

Known problem:
Finally, the program seems fine and works as expected.
However, I could not really figure out the format with LaTex. There are two .pdf files for 
report, one is created by LaTex, and another is exported from a .pages file.

Instruction for running program:
Compile main.cpp file by g++ through console, run the output file a.out or customize the name of the output file. Then follow the instruction inside the program.
